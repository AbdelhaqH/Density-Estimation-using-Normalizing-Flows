# Density-Estimation-using-Normalizing-Flows

As a school project, I completed a study on Normalizing Flow and its applications with two other classmates.

Normalizing Flows are a family of generative models for modeling complex probability distributions. They enable us to learn a complex probability density from a simple one. They are based on transforming a simple probability density into a more complex one through a series of a series of non-linear transformations. These models have recently attracted the interest to the machine learning community due to their ability to generate high-quality samples from target distributions.

Some examples of Normalizing flows using the Real NVP model may be found in this project:

- A point cloud restoration demonstration in the file Half Moon RealNVP.py 
- A MNIST database application in the file MNIST RealNVP.py
- In the folder NVPdensityMultivariate.py, there are an examples of reconstruction from gaussian distributions. Firstly in 1 dimension in the file "Mixture_CDF_Gaussians.py", there are two construction with a mixture of 1 or 2 gaussians.
